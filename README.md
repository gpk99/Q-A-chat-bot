# Q-A-chat-bot

## objective
This project aims to develop a question-answering chatbot capable of being trained on a data dump. The bot should also be able to incorporate additional text data and fetch up-to-date information from the web using LangChain for answering specific tasks.

## problem this model solves:

This chatbot addresses the need for an intelligent and dynamic system to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries. By utilizing a data dump for initial training, allowing for ongoing learning with additional text, and integrating web scraping capabilities through LangChain, the model aims to stay updated and offer valuable information across a wide range of topics. This versatility makes it suitable for various applications, from general knowledge inquiries to specific task-oriented questions

## project life cycle
